| # | Information | What It Indicates | How It Is Obtained | Why It Is Important |
|---|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| 1 | Production Package ID & Metadata | A unique identifier for the specific print job and its basic context. | Automatically generated by the Logger Service upon initialization. Includes timestamp and the lab's public key. | Provides a unique, non-fungible identity for the asset and its data history on the decentralized network. |
| 2 | Raw Material IDs & Certificates | The specific batch and origin of constituent materials (cement, aggregates, admixtures). | Sourced from supplier documentation. Hashed and signed to prevent tampering. | Ensures traceability to the source. Critical for diagnosing material-related failures and for lifecycle analysis. |
| 3 | Target Mix Design | The intended material composition (e.g., water-to-cement ratio, admixture doses). | Defined by the process engineer in the digital recipe and logged at the start. | Serves as the foundational benchmark against which the as-produced material and final performance are evaluated. |
| 4 | Target Rheological Properties | The desired workability and printability of the concrete (yield stress, viscosity). | Defined based on material characterization and print requirements. Logged at package initialization. | Provides the quantitative target for the mLLM and process controllers to maintain during printing. |
| 5 | Print G-code (Digital File Hash) | The exact instructions for the robotic printer's toolpath. | The digital G-code file is cryptographically hashed. The hash is logged, not the full file. | Verifies that the intended design was used, preventing errors or unauthorized modifications to the printing instructions. |
| 6 | Environmental Targets | The intended ambient conditions (Temperature, Relative Humidity) for the print. | Defined by the process engineer based on material specifications. | Establishes the environmental baseline, crucial for understanding curing behavior and diagnosing issues related to ambient conditions. |
| 7 | In-Process Sensor Data | The real-time state of the material and process (pressure, flow rate, actual rheology). | Continuously captured from in-line sensors (rheometers, pressure transducers), time-synchronized, and appended by the Logger Service. | Provides a quantitative, second-by-second record of the process stability, used for real-time control and post-hoc analysis. |
| 8 | In-Process Vision & Scan Data | The visual and geometric quality of the print during fabrication (bead shape, layer alignment). | Captured by industrial cameras and 3D laser scanners. Images and scan summaries (e.g., deviation heat maps) are hashed and logged. | Serves as the visual evidence for the mLLM's decisions and for verifying geometric compliance with the digital model. |
| 9 | mLLM Prompts & JSON Responses | The "reasoning" of the AI orchestrator—what it was asked to analyze and what it concluded. | The Logger Service captures every prompt sent to the mLLM and its full, structured JSON response. | Creates a complete audit trail of the AI's decision-making process, essential for debugging, trust, and understanding failure modes. |
| 10 | Compensatory G-code Commands | The specific adjustments made by the system in response to detected faults. | Logged by the Logger Service after being parsed from the mLLM's output and sent to the robot controller. | Documents the closed-loop corrective actions taken, linking a diagnosed problem to its engineered solution. |
| 11 | Mechanical Performance Data | The achieved structural properties of the printed element (compressive/flexural strength). | Obtained from destructive or non-destructive tests (e.g., ASTM C39 compression tests) on specimens extracted from the print or the structure itself after curing. | This is the ultimate validation of the process, quantitatively proving the element's fitness for purpose and its final quality. |
| 12 | Final Assigned Grade | A holistic quality score (e.g., Grade M20, M30, …) for the finished element. | Assigned by an engineer or an automated system based on a synthesis of the mechanical performance data and the recorded production history. | Provides a simple, summary indicator of quality that is backed by the entire, verifiable data history in the package. |
| 13 | Final Certification Hash | A digital seal that locks the package and confirms its integrity and completeness. | Generated by the Smart Contract when the package is finalized, creating a permanent, tamper-proof certificate. | Prevents any further alterations, making the entire Production Package a legally and technically robust document for verification. |
